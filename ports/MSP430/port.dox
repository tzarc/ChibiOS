 * @brief MSP430 Configuration Options.
 * @details The MSP430 port allows some architecture-specific configurations
 * settings that can be specified externally, as example on the compiler
 * command line:
 * - @p INT_REQUIRED_STACK, this value represent the amount of stack space
 *   used by the interrupt handlers.<br>
 *   The default for this value is @p 32, this space is allocated for each
 *   thread so be careful in order to not waste precious RAM space.<br>
 *   The default value is set into <b>./ports/MSP430/chcore.h</b>.
