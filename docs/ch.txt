 * @page Concepts Concepts
 * @{
 * @section naming Naming Conventions
 * ChibiOS/RT APIs are all named following this convention:
 * \a ch\<group\>\<action\>\<suffix\>().
 * The possible groups are: \a Sys, \a Sch, \a VT, \a Thd, \a Sem, \a Mtx,
 * \a Evt, \a Msg, \a IQ, \a OQ, \a HQ,\a FDD, \a HDD, \a Dbg, \a Heap, \a Pool.
 * The suffix is not present for normal APIs but can be one of
 * the following: "I" for APIs meant to be invoked within the system mutex
 * zone, "S" for APIs only usable from within the system mutex zone but not
 * from interrupt handlers.<br>
 * The APIs without suffix can be invoked only from the user code outsize the
 * system mutex zone and not from interrupt handlers unless differently
 * specified.<br>
 * Examples: \p chThdCreateStatic(), \p chSemSignalI(), \p chIQGetTimeout().
 *
 * @section scheduling Scheduling
 * The strategy is very simple the currently ready thread with the highest
 * priority is executed. If more than one thread with equal priority are
 * eligible for execution then they are executed in a round-robin way, the
 * CPU time slice constant is configurable. The ready list is a double linked
 * list of threads ordered by priority.<br><br>
 * @image html readylist.png
 * Note that the currently running thread is not in the ready list, the list
 * only contains the threads ready to be executed but still actually waiting.
 *
 * The image shows how threads can change their state in ChibiOS/RT.<br>

 *
 * @section priority Priority Levels
 * Priorities in ChibiOS/RT are a contiguous numerical range but the initial
 * and final values are not enforced.<br>
 * The following table describes the various priority boundaries (from lowest
 *   to highest):
 * - @p IDLEPRIO, this is the lowest priority level and is reserved for the
 *   idle thread, no other threads should share this priority level. This is
 *   the lowest numerical value of the priorities space.
 * - @p LOWPRIO, the lowest priority level that can be assigned to an user
 *   thread.
 * - @p NORMALPRIO, this is the central priority level for user threads. It is
 *   advisable to assign priorities to threads as values relative to
 *   @p NORMALPRIO, as example NORMALPRIO-1 or NORMALPRIO+4, this ensures the
 *   portability of code should the numerical range change in future
 *   implementations.
 * - @p HIGHPRIO, the highest priority level that can be assigned to an user
 *   thread.
 * - @p ABSPRO, absolute maximum software priority level, it can be higher than
 *   @p HIGHPRIO but the numerical values above @p HIGHPRIO up to @p ABSPRIO
 *   (inclusive) are reserved. This is the highest numerical value of the
 *   priorities space.
 *
 * @section warea Thread Working Area
 * Each thread has its own stack, a Thread structure and some preemption
 * areas. All the structures are allocated into a "Thread working area",
 * a thread private heap, usually allocated in a char array declared in your
 * code, there is not a central threads table or list, this means you can
 * have as many threads you want as long you have enough available RAM
 * memory. The threads do not use any memory outside the allocated working
 * area.<br><br>
 * @image html workspace.png
 * <br>
 * Note that the preemption area is only present when the thread is not
 * running (switched out), the context switching is done by pushing the
 * registers on the stack of the switched-out thread and popping the registers
 * of the switched-in thread from its stack.
 * The preemption area can be divided in up to three structures:
 * - External context.
 * - Interrupt stack.
 * - Internal context.
 *
 * See the @ref Core documentation for details, the area may change on
 * the various ports and some structures may not be present (or be zero-sized).
 *
 * @section sysmutex System Mutex Zone
 * It is the code within the OS that cannot be preempted, this code is
 * everything between the \p chSysLock() and \p chSysUnlock() API calls.
 * The implementation of the APIs in most cases just enables/disables the
 * interrupts. Of course the code in the system mutex zone must be as short
 * and efficient possible as it affects the RT performance of the whole
 * system. The worst case response time is affected by the longest code
 * path in the system mutex zone or interrupt handler.
 * @code
 * // User code, not critical, preemption possible.
 * chSysLock();
 * ...
 * // System critical code, preemption delayed.
 * ...
 * chSysUnlock();
 * // User code, preemption possible again.
 * @endcode
 * Applications usually do not need to put code into the system mutex zone
 * unless you are implementing device drivers or special synchronization
 * primitives, everything else can be implemented by using semaphores,
 * mutexes, messages or events.

/**
 * @defgroup ARM7 ARM7TDMI
 * @{
 * <p>
 * The ARM7 port supports 3 modes:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Pure ARM mode, this is the preferred mode for code speed. The code size
 *     is larger however. This mode is enabled when all the modules are compiled
 *     in ARM mode, see the Makefiles.</li>
 * <li>Pure THUMB mode, this is the preferred mode for code size. In this mode
 *     the execution speed is slower than the ARM mode. This mode is enabled
 *     when all the modules are compiled in THUMB mode, see the Makefiles.</li>
 * <li>Interworking mode, when in the system there are ARM modules mixed with
 *     THUMB modules then the interworking compiler option is enabled. This is
 *     usually the slowest mode and the code size is not as good as in pure
 *     THUMB mode.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The ARM7 port makes some assumptions on the application code organization:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The \p main() function is invoked in system mode.</li>
 * <li>Each thread has a private user/system stack, the system has a single
 *     interrupt stack where all the interrupts are processed.</li>
 * <li>The threads are started in system mode.</li>
 * <li>The threads code can run in system mode or user mode, however the
 *     code running in user mode cannot invoke the ChibiOS/RT APIs directly
 *     because privileged instructions are used inside.<br>
 *     The kernel APIs can be eventually invoked by using a SWI entry point
 *     that handles the switch in system mode and the return in user mode.</li>
 * <li>Other modes are not preempt-able because the system code assumes the
 *     threads running in system mode. When running in supervisor or other
 *     modes make sure that the interrupts are globally disabled.</li>
 * <li>Interrupts nesting is not supported in the ARM7 code because their
 *     implementation, even if possible, is not really efficient in this
 *     architecture.</li>
 * <li>FIQ sources can preempt the kernel (by design) so it is not possible to
 *     invoke the kernel APIs from inside a FIQ handler. FIQ handlers are not
 *     affected by the kernel activity so there is not added jitter.</li>
 * <li>Interrupt handlers do not save function-saved registers so you need to
 *     make sure your code saves them or does not use them (this happens
 *     because in the ARM7 port all the OS interrupt handlers are declared
 *     naked).<br>
 *     Function-trashed registers (R0-R3,R12,LR,SR) are saved/restored by the
 *     system macros \p chSysIRQEnterI() and \p chSysIRQExitI().<br>
 *     The easiest way to ensure this is to just invoke a function from within
 *     the interrupt handler, the function code will save all the required
 *     registers.<br>
 *     Example:
 * @code
 * __attribute__((naked, weak))
 * void irq_handler(void) {
 *   chSysIRQEnterI();
 *
 *   serve_interrupt();
 *
 *   VICVectAddr = 0; // This is LPC214x-specific.
 *   chSysIRQExitI();
 * }
 * @endcode
 *     This is not a bug but an implementation choice, this solution allows to
 *     have interrupt handlers compiled in thumb mode without have to use an
 *     interworking mode (the mode switch is hidden in the macros), this
 *     greatly improves code efficiency and size. You can look at the serial
 *     driver for real examples of interrupt handlers.</li>

 * inheritance mechanism in order handle the priority inversion problem.<br>
 * When a thread is queued on a mutex, any thread, directly or indirectly,
 * holding the mutex gains the same priority of the waiting thread (if their
 * priority was not already equal or higher). The mechanism works with any
 * number of nested mutexes and any number of involved threads. The algorithm
 * complexity (worst case) is N with N equal to the number of nested mutexes.

 * Event Sources and Event Listeners.<br>
 * <b>Operation mode</b><br><br>
 * An Event Source is a special object that can be signaled by a thread or
 * an interrupt service routine. Signaling an Event Source has the effect
 * that all the threads registered on the Event Source will receive
 * and serve the event.<br>
 * An unlimited number of Event Sources can exists in a system and each
 * thread can listen on an unlimited number of them.<br>
 * Note that the events can be asynchronously generated but are synchronously
 * served, a thread can serve event by calling a \p chEvtWaitXXX()
 * API. If an event is generated while a listening thread is not ready to
 * serve it then the event becomes "pending" and will be served as soon the
 * thread invokes a \p chEvtWaitXXX().<br>
 * In order to use the Event APIs the \p CH_USE_EVENTS option must be
 * specified in \p chconf.h.

 * <b>Operation Mode</b><br><br>
 * Messages are an easy to use and fast IPC mechanism, threads can both serve
 * messages and send messages to other threads, the mechanism allows data to
 * be carried in both directions. Data is not copied between the client and
 * server threads but just a pointer passed so the exchange is very time
 * efficient.<br>
 * Messages are usually processed in FIFO order but it is possible to process
 * them in priority order by specifying CH_USE_MESSAGES_PRIORITY
 * in \p chconf.h.<br>
 * Threads do not need to allocate space for message queues, the mechanism
 * just requires two extra pointers in the \p Thread structure (the message
 * queue header).<br>
 * In order to use the Messages APIs the \p CH_USE_MESSAGES option must be
 * specified in \p chconf.h.

 * @defgroup IOQueues I/O Queues
 * @{
 * ChibiOS/RT supports several kinds of queues. The queues are mostly used
 * in serial-like device drivers. The device drivers are usually designed to
 * have a lower side (lower driver, it is usually an interrupt service
 * routine) and an upper side (upper driver, accessed by the application
 * threads).<br>
 * There are several kind of queues:<br>
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Input queue</b>, unidirectional queue where the writer is the
 *     lower side and the reader is the upper side.</li>
 * <li><b>Output queue</b>, unidirectional queue where the writer is the
 *     upper side and the reader is the lower side.</li>
 * <li><b>Half duplex queue</b>, bidirectional queue where the buffer is shared
 *     between a receive and a transmit queues. This means that concurrent
 *     buffered input and output operations are not possible, this is perfectly
 *     acceptable for a lot of applications however, as example an RS485 driver.
 * <li><b>Full duplex queue</b>, bidirectional queue where read and write
 *     operations can happen at the same time. Full duplex queues
 *     are implemented by pairing an input queue and an output queue together.
 * </ul>
 * In order to use the I/O queues the \p CH_USE_QUEUES option must
 * be specified in \p chconf.h.<br>
 * In order to use the half duplex queues the \p CH_USE_QUEUES_HALFDUPLEX
 * option must be specified in \p chconf.h.
