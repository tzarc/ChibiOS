- Enhanced circular trace buffer storing more kinds of events:
  - Context Switch (what we have now).
  - ISR enter.
    - Problem, how to identify the ISR in the context of the CH_IRQ_PROLOGUE()
      macro? use __func__.
  - ISR exit.
    - Problem, how to identify the ISR in the context of the CH_IRQ_EPILOGUE()
      macro? use __func__.
  - API calls.
    - We would need switches to enable which APIs should be traced, tracing
      all of them would fill the buffer too quickly.
