    ChibiOS/RT - Copyright (C) 2006,2007,2008,2009,2010 Giovanni Di Sirio.

 *
 * <h2>Contributions and Copyright Assignment</h2>
 * If you plan to contribute code to the ChibiOS/RT project then there is a
 * requirement you should be aware of: contributing code for inclusion in
 * the ChibiOS/RT <b>main line</b> requires  assigning the copyright on the
 * contributed code to me (Giovanni Di Sirio).<br>
 * This may sound a bit strange but is pretty standard for this kind of
 * projects, there are several reasons for this requirement:
 * - ChibiOS/RT will probably also become a commercial product and it would
 *   not be possible to re-license the code without ownership. Note that the
 *   commercial product would not be a different or better product, just the
 *   same GPL product made available, on request, under a different license.
 *   The code will always be available to you under the current licensing
 *   terms.
 * - Ownership is required when changing the licensing terms and this happens
 *   each time the project goes from development/unstable to stable and
 *   back because the addition/removal of the GPL linking exception.
 * - It will be easier for the project adopters to have a single ownership
 *   point in case of licensing issues (both GPL or commercial).
 * - Losing the ownership on the code could preclude me the opportunity to
 *   make this project a full time job as I hope.
 * - I definitely don't want to have to sort out copyright related issues
 *   in the future so better be clear than sorry.
 * .
 * Note that contributions will always be welcome even without such copyright
 * assignment, the difference is that the contributed code would not be
 * merged into the main line, it will still made available as contributed
 * code with the contributor(s) copyright notice intact.<br>
 * Submissions of code with copyright notice should only happen through
 * email, please do not commit code with copyright notices directly on
 * the repository.<br>
 * When submitting code please <b>state clearly your intention to keep the
 * copyright</b> on your work by adding your own copyright notice within the
 * source code and by clearly mentioning your intentions in the message. Code
 * contributed without copyright notice will be considered donated.<br>
 * If in doubt with licensing issues please don't hesitate to contact me
 * in order to sort out any problem you may have.<br>
 * Of course the copyright assignment does not mean you would not be
 * recognized for your hard work, see the following section.
