Possible developments notes

HAL
- Absolute timeouts in byte queues like it is done in buffers queues.
- Change byte queues callback handling like it is done in buffers queue.

RT
- Remove queues and streams, it is duplicated in the HAL.
- Make the CH_CFG_NO_IDLE_THREAD option behave RT like NIL, with a table of
  threads to spawn immediately on chSysInit(). This would make the two even
  more compatible at source level.
- Remove terminate flag, it can be handled by an event flag, this saves a
  field in the thread structure and simplifies the API.

OSLIB
- Move core, heaps, pools, mailboxes out of RT into an "OS library" usable
  by both RT and NIL.
  - Removes dependencies between RT and linker script.
- Heap allocator able to return blocks aligned to arbitrary power of 2
  boundaries.
- Add a "mail" module.
