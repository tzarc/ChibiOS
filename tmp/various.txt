Possible developments notes

Kernel Ports
- Move startups from /os/common/ports to /os/common/startup.
- Unified NIL-RT ports.
  - NIL and RT need to use the same symbols (configuration switches).
  - Place unified ports in /os/common/ports.

HAL
- Absolute timeouts in byte queues like it is done in buffers queues.
- Change byte queues callback handling like it is done in buffers queue.

NIL
- Use CH_ instead of NIL_ for configuration options and any other symbol,
  reduce differences to a minimum.
- Introduction of state checker.
- Separate parameter checks from assertions.
- Create a ch.h alias of nil.h in order to make the two compatible at source
  level. Alternatively rename it to ch.c/ch.h.

RT
- Remove queues and streams, it is duplicated in the HAL.
- Make the CH_CFG_NO_IDLE_THREAD option behave RT like NIL, with a table of
  threads to spawn immediately on chSysInit(). This would make the two even
  more compatible at source level.

OSLIB
- Move core, heaps, pools, mailboxes out of RT into an "OS library" usable
  by both RT and NIL.
  - Removes dependencies between RT and linker script.
- Add a "mail" module.
