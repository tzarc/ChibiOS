Marked with [*] means that a slide is required.

Program:

1) 14:00 - People Introduction (15 minutes).
  a) Introduction about myself (2 minutes).
    - Mention ST.
    - Mention ChibiOS/RT.
  b) Attending people introduction (remaining time).
  c) Rules: feel free to interrupt me and ask questions.

2) 14:15 - Introduction to RTOS technology.
  a) Definition of a Realtime System.
    - Non realtime.
    - Soft realtime.
    - Hard realtime.
    - Boundary between hard realtime and soft realtime, time scale.
  b) The importance of the worst case.
  c) What an RTOS is not.
  d) What is an RTOS.
    - Defining the requirements for an RTOS.

3) 14:45 Approaches to realtime.
  a) Event Driven or superloop.
    - Single stack.
    - Easy to program.
    - The worst code path is also the worst case, always.
  b) State machines.
    - Single stack.
    - Long tasks can be split in several arcs by increasing the
      number of states.
    - Hard to program.
    - It becomes harder as the number of states increases.
  c) Non-preemptive multi tasking.
    - Multiple stacks.
    - The execution time of the longer task is also the worst case,
      ultimately not better than the superloop.
  d) Preemptive multi tasking.
    - Multiple stacks.
    - There is no intrinsic restriction in the tasks duration.
    - The response time is only dictated by the task duration of
      tasks at higher priority.
    - Tasks at lower priority have no impact on tasks at higher priority.

4) xx:xx Tasks and Interrupts
  a) Are tasks and interrupts really different? not as far response time
     estimation is concerned.
  b) Importance of interrupts architecture:
    - Single interrupt source.
    - Multiple sources with priority.
    - Priority masking vs global interrupts disable.
    - Segmented interrupts.
