- Protected Pools. This would require the use of an MPU. Variables could
  be declared to belong to a "protected pool" (a memory section). Pools would
  be by default not accessible by threads unless threads attach them using an
  API. This would allow to have variables that are only accessible by certain
  threads improving system safety.
  - The number of pools that a thread could attach would be limited by the
    number of available MPU descriptors.
  - How to handle pools from ISRs?
