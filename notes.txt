Ideas for NIL-4:

- It should be possible to start/terminate threads.
- Add chthdExit() and chThdWait().
- Any change must not sacrifice minimal size which is NIL strong point.
  - Maximum size is going to grow depending on enabled additional features.
- Add synchronous messages.
- Add thread local storage option (storing the argument pointer in the thread
  structure), Add a function chThdGetArgument(), add it to RT too.

Open points:

- Remove the autostart table or keep it? or add it to RT too? make it optional?
- Should it get the full events like RT? if so, move events to library and make
  it a shared module?
- Split it in multiple files or keep everything in one module?
  - It is growing, it makes no sense to still cram it all in a single file.
- Is there the risk for NIL to lose identity? it is getting closer to RT.
  - It will never have dynamic priorities, virtual timers, priority
    inheritance, real mutexes, condition variables, dynamic threads,
    advanced debugging, registry, statistics, tracing, high resolution,
    time measurement. Is this sufficient?
